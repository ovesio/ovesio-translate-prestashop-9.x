## Overview

The Ovesio AI Module integrates PrestaShop with [Ovesio.com](https://ovesio.com/), enabling AI-powered translations and automatic content generation (descriptions and SEO meta tags) for your e-commerce store.

## Key Features

### Compatibility

- Fully compatible with PrestaShop 9.0+
- Built with modern PrestaShop architecture using Symfony controllers

### Translation Capabilities

- Translations are performed automatically in the background
- Once a translation is completed, it is updated on the website — translations are not instant
- Translations are available for:
  - Product names
  - Descriptions
  - Meta titles and keywords
  - Feature attributes
  - Feature values
  - Attribute groups
  - Product combinations/attributes
  - Category names and descriptions
- Translations are not repeated unless the original content has changed

### Description Generation

- Automatic AI-generated descriptions for both products and categories
- Custom logic for when to generate:
  - For products/categories with existing descriptions shorter than a defined character limit
  - For out-of-stock products
  - For disabled products and categories
- Two modes available:
  - One time only
  - On each resource update
- Descriptions are also performed in the background, not instantly

### SEO Meta Tag Generation

- Fully automated generation of SEO meta titles, meta descriptions, and meta keywords using Ovesio AI
- Configurable from the AI SEO MetaTags Generator section
- Available for both products and categories
- SEO meta tag generation supports:
  - Out-of-stock products
  - Disabled products and categories
- Two generation modes supported:
  - One time only (meta tags are generated a single time)
  - On each product or category update (meta tags are regenerated every time a resource is edited)

### AI Description Generator Options

From the AI Description Generator section:

- Enable/disable product and category description generation
- Set thresholds:
  - Ignore product descriptions longer than X characters
  - Ignore category descriptions longer than X characters
- Set inclusion logic for out-of-stock and disabled products/categories
- Choose when new descriptions should be created:
  - One time only
  - On each update

### Cron Integration

- Automate processing with a cron job:
  ```bash
  */5 * * * * curl -k -L "https://yourdomain.com/ovesio/cron?hash=YOUR_HASH" > /dev/null 2>&1
  ```
- The cron job:
  - Runs every 5 minutes (recommended)
  - Processes queued entries
  - Triggers translations, description and meta tag generation
- The cron URL and hash are available in the module configuration

## Technical Details

### Requirements

- PHP >= 7.2.5
- PrestaShop 9.0.0 or higher
- Composer (for development)
- Valid Ovesio API Token

### Module Structure

The module follows PrestaShop 9 best practices:

- **Controllers**: Symfony-based admin controllers in `src/Controller/Admin/`
- **Models**: Database operations in `model/`
- **SDK**: Ovesio API client in `lib/sdk/`
- **Hooks**: Automated triggers for product/category updates
- **Queue System**: Background processing for AI operations

### Registered Hooks

The module registers the following PrestaShop hooks:

- `actionObjectProductUpdateAfter` - Triggered after product update
- `actionObjectCategoryUpdateAfter` - Triggered after category update
- `actionObjectFeatureUpdateAfter` - Triggered after feature update
- `actionObjectFeatureValueAddAfter` - Triggered after feature value add
- `actionObjectFeatureValueUpdateAfter` - Triggered after feature value update
- `actionObjectAttributeGroupUpdateAfter` - Triggered after attribute group update
- `actionObjectProductAttributeAddAfter` - Triggered after combination add
- `actionObjectProductAttributeUpdateAfter` - Triggered after combination update
- `displayDashboardToolbarTopMenu` - Dashboard integration
- `actionAdminControllerSetMedia` - Admin assets loading

## Usage Summary

- Descriptions, meta tags, and translations are executed asynchronously in the background
- Operations can be triggered once or on every update, based on configuration
- Translations are processed once unless content is modified
- Use the activity list to monitor processing status and errors
- Ensure cron is set up for full automation

## Troubleshooting

### Module not appearing in Module Manager

- Ensure the folder is named exactly `ovesio` in the `modules/` directory
- Check file permissions (folders: 755, files: 644)
- Clear PrestaShop cache from **Advanced Parameters > Performance**

### Translations not processing

- Verify API token is correct
- Check that cron job is running properly
- Review the activity list for errors
- Ensure the callback URL is accessible

### API connection errors

- Verify the API URL is correct (default: `https://api.ovesio.com/v1/`)
- Check your API token is valid
- Ensure your server can make outbound HTTPS requests
- Check firewall settings
